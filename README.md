# Feedly Subscriber

Feedly Subscriber is a Chrome extension for [Feedly](http://cloud.feedly.com),
which allows you to easily add new feeds, one click away!

I made this as a superior alternative to Google's
[RSS subscription extension](http://bit.ly/googlerss-extension), specifically for Feedly.

## Install

You can install this extension directly from the
Google Chrome webstore by clicking this banner:
